Develop a bus ticket booking system.
● It should contain the user module with the Signup and Login Process.
● Should contain admin and user profiles.
● The admin has the privilege to add, update and delete the buses.
● Refer to Redbus for examples.
● The user can book the ticket of the bus for a particular date to travel.
● The user should receive an error message when the tickets are full on the bus.
● Backend APIs are enough. No front-end code is required.
